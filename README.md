Setup databases on Postgre: 
  Churn database
    ->customter_churn
    ->processed_customer_churn

Test Vscode -> Postgre connection with py test script
}

Below is a list of issues, no matter how small I come across or how fast they are solved for future reference.
Issues:

Ran test script to authenticate with Postgre from vs:
"PS C:\Users\BenAH\OneDrive\Desktop\apache-pipeline\scripts> python test_postgres.py
>> 
‚ùå Connection failed: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "postgres"
Had to reset password, defaulted to something I didn't set.
